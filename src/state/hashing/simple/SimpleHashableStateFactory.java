/**
 * A straightforward factory for creating {@link burlap.statehashing.HashableState} objects from
 * {@link State} instances. It produces either a {@link IISimpleHashableState} or a
 * {@link IDSimpleHashableState}.
 * The general approach is that hash values are computed by iterating through each
 * variable key in the order returned by {@link State#variableKeys()} and the has code for values returned by
 * {@link State#get(Object)} are combined. Similarly, two states are evaluated as equal when the values returned by
 * {@link State#get(Object)} satisfy their implemented {@link Object#equals(Object)} method.
 * <p>
 * This class also automatically provides special treatment for OO-MDP states (states that implement
 * {@link burlap.mdp.core.oo.state.OOState}) by being object identifier independent
 * (the names of objects don't affect the state identity). However, you may disable identifier independence
 * by using the constructor {@link #SimpleHashableStateFactory(boolean)}. If your domain is relational, it may be
 * important to be identifier *dependent* (that is, set the parameter in the constructor to false).
